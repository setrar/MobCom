    "- **Purpose**:\n",
    "  - To improve the reliability of data transmission by adding redundancy, enabling the receiver to detect and correct errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How it works**:\n",
    "  - Encoding involves **shift registers** and **generator polynomials** to create output bits as a function of current and past input bits.\n",
    "  - Example of an encoding process:\n",
    "    - Input bits: $u = [1, 0, 1]$\n",
