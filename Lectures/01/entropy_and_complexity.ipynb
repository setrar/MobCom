    "This image illustrates the concepts of entropy and complexity using three glasses containing a mixture of liquids (likely coffee and milk) at different stages of mixing:\n",
    "\t1.\tLeft Glass (Low Entropy, Low Complexity):\n",
    "\t•\tThe liquids are separated, with a clear boundary between the dark and light layers.\n",
    "\t•\tLow Entropy: The system is ordered, with distinct separation, indicating a low degree of disorder.\n",
    "\t•\tLow Complexity: The structure is simple, as there is no interaction or mixing between the two liquids.\n",
    "\t2.\tMiddle Glass (Medium Entropy, High Complexity):\n",
    "\t•\tThe liquids are partially mixed, creating layers and swirls.\n",
    "\t•\tMedium Entropy: There is some disorder due to partial mixing, but it’s not completely random.\n",
    "\t•\tHigh Complexity: The pattern is intricate, with layers and gradients, representing a higher level of structural complexity due to the interaction between the two liquids.\n",
    "\t3.\tRight Glass (High Entropy, Low Complexity):\n",
    "\t•\tThe liquids are fully mixed, resulting in a uniform color.\n",
    "\t•\tHigh Entropy: The system has reached a state of maximum disorder, with no visible distinction between the two liquids.\n",
    "\t•\tLow Complexity: The structure is now simple and uniform, as there are no layers or gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tEntropy measures the degree of disorder: higher entropy means greater disorder.\n",
    "\t•\tComplexity refers to the level of intricate structure: the middle stage has high complexity due to the distinct, interacting patterns, whereas the fully mixed state has low complexity because it lacks visible structure."
