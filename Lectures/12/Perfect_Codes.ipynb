        "\n",
        "The **Sphere Packing Bound**, also known as the **Hamming Bound**, is a key concept in coding theory that ensures the error-correcting code can pack spheres (error spheres) in the code space without overlap.\n",
        "\n",
        "For a block code $[n, k, d]$ over a finite field of size $q$, the bound is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$M \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^t \\binom{n}{i}(q-1)^i \\leq q^n$\n",
        "\n",
        "- $M = q^k$: Number of codewords in the code.  \n",
        "- $t = \\lfloor (d-1)/2 \\rfloor$: Number of errors the code can correct (error-correcting capability).  \n",

        "**Perfect codes** are codes that achieve the Sphere Packing Bound **with equality**. This means the code space is completely filled with non-overlapping spheres, leaving no unused space.\n",

        "1. **Spheres Cover Entire Space**: The codewords' error spheres exactly fill the space of size $q^n$, with no gaps or overlaps.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Binary Repetition Codes**:\n",
        "   - Codes like $[n, 1, n]$, where a single bit is repeated $n$ times.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Trivial Codes**:\n",
        "   - $[n, n, 1]$: No redundancy, no error correction.\n",
        "   - $[n, 1, n]$: Maximum redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Golay Codes**:\n",
        "   - Binary Golay code $[23, 12, 7]$: Can correct 3 errors.\n",
