    "**Polar Codes, LDPC Codes, and Turbo Codes** are all powerful error-correcting codes (ECC) widely used in modern communication systems. Each has unique characteristics, advantages, and use cases. Here is a detailed comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Polar Codes**\n",
    "- **Inventor:** Erdal Arıkan (2008).\n",
    "- **Principle:** Based on the concept of channel polarization, where channels are polarized into either highly reliable or completely unreliable channels.\n",
    "- **Key Features:**\n",
    "  - **Capacity-Achieving:** Proven to achieve the Shannon capacity for binary-input symmetric memoryless channels.\n",
    "  - **Encoding/Decoding:** Uses recursive algorithms for encoding; successive cancellation (SC) and successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding are common.\n",
    "  - **Complexity:** \n",
    "    - **Encoding:** \\(O(N \\log N)\\), where \\(N\\) is the block length.\n",
    "    - **Decoding:** \\(O(N \\log N)\\).\n",
    "  - **Latency:** Lower latency compared to Turbo Codes due to simpler decoding structure.\n",
    "- **Applications:** Adopted for 5G NR (control channels) due to low latency and high efficiency for short block lengths.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Low complexity.\n",
    "  - Optimal performance for short block lengths.\n",
    "  - Simpler hardware implementation compared to LDPC and Turbo Codes.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - SC decoding is suboptimal for practical scenarios.\n",
    "  - Performance at longer block lengths is not as strong as LDPC.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) Codes**\n",
    "- **Inventor:** Robert Gallager (1960s, rediscovered in the 1990s).\n",
    "- **Principle:** Sparse parity-check matrices are used for encoding and iterative message-passing algorithms for decoding.\n",
    "- **Key Features:**\n",
    "  - **Capacity-Achieving:** Excellent performance near the Shannon limit, especially for long block lengths.\n",
    "  - **Encoding/Decoding:** Encoding complexity depends on matrix sparsity; decoding uses belief propagation (iterative) algorithms.\n",
    "  - **Complexity:**\n",
    "    - **Encoding:** \\(O(N^2)\\) for general matrices, but optimized implementations exist.\n",
    "    - **Decoding:** \\(O(N)\\) per iteration.\n",
    "  - **Latency:** Iterative decoding introduces higher latency compared to Polar Codes.\n",
    "- **Applications:** Widely used in 5G NR (data channels), Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11), DVB-S2, and other high-throughput systems.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Exceptional performance for long block lengths.\n",
    "  - Highly parallelizable decoding algorithms.\n",
    "  - Flexibility in designing code rates and lengths.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - Higher hardware complexity for encoding.\n",
    "  - Decoding performance depends on the number of iterations, increasing power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Turbo Codes**\n",
    "- **Inventor:** Claude Berrou et al. (1993).\n",
    "- **Principle:** Combines two or more convolutional codes with an interleaver for superior error correction.\n",
    "- **Key Features:**\n",
    "  - **Capacity-Achieving:** Near-capacity performance, especially for medium to long block lengths.\n",
    "  - **Encoding/Decoding:** Encoding is straightforward; decoding uses iterative algorithms like MAP or log-MAP.\n",
    "  - **Complexity:**\n",
    "    - **Encoding:** \\(O(N)\\).\n",
    "    - **Decoding:** \\(O(N \\times \\text{iterations})\\).\n",
    "  - **Latency:** Higher than Polar and LDPC due to iterative decoding.\n",
    "- **Applications:** Used in 3G and 4G LTE standards for data channels, as well as satellite communications.\n",
    "- **Advantages:**\n",
    "  - Strong performance at medium to long block lengths.\n",
    "  - Proven and robust for a variety of channels.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:**\n",
    "  - High latency due to iterative decoding.\n",
    "  - Higher power consumption compared to Polar Codes.\n",
    "  - Limited scalability and flexibility compared to LDPC.\n",
