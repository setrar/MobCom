    "Good design criteria for **space-time (ST) codes** focus on maximizing reliability, efficiency, and ease of decoding in MIMO systems. Key criteria include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diversity Criterion**: Maximize the diversity order by ensuring the code achieves **full spatial diversity**. This is done by designing codeword difference matrices that are full rank, which provides robustness against fading.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coding Gain Criterion**: Maximize the **minimum determinant** of the codeword difference matrices over all distinct codeword pairs. A larger minimum determinant increases the separation between codewords, which enhances error performance by reducing the chance of symbol confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rate Criterion**: Design codes that achieve **high spectral efficiency**, maximizing the number of information symbols per channel use while maintaining diversity and coding gain. High-rate codes allow better data throughput without sacrificing reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Orthogonality Criterion**: Where possible, design **orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal codes** to enable linear, low-complexity decoding. Orthogonal codes (e.g., Alamouti code for 2 transmit antennas) simplify the receiver design and reduce computational burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiplexing-Diversity Tradeoff**: For systems that require both high data rate and reliability, design codes that achieve a balance between **spatial multiplexing** (to increase data rate) and **diversity** (to reduce errors), based on the specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "These criteria ensure that ST codes provide **reliable, efficient, and scalable** performance in various MIMO communication environments."
