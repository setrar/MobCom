    "focus on maximizing reliability, efficiency, and ease of decoding in MIMO systems. Key criteria include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Diversity Criterion**: Maximize the diversity order by ensuring the code achieves **full spatial diversity**. This is done by designing codeword difference matrices that are full rank, which provides robustness against fading.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coding Gain Criterion**: Maximize the **minimum determinant** of the codeword difference matrices over all distinct codeword pairs. A larger minimum determinant increases the separation between codewords, which enhances error performance by reducing the chance of symbol confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Rate Criterion**: Design codes that achieve **high spectral efficiency**, maximizing the number of information symbols per channel use while maintaining diversity and coding gain. High-rate codes allow better data throughput without sacrificing reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Orthogonality Criterion**: Where possible, design **orthogonal or quasi-orthogonal codes** to enable linear, low-complexity decoding. Orthogonal codes (e.g., Alamouti code for 2 transmit antennas) simplify the receiver design and reduce computational burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Multiplexing-Diversity Tradeoff**: For systems that require both high data rate and reliability, design codes that achieve a balance between **spatial multiplexing** (to increase data rate) and **diversity** (to reduce errors), based on the specific requirements of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "These criteria ensure that ST codes provide **reliable, efficient, and scalable** performance in various MIMO communication environments."

    "### Definitions and Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Codeword Set**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\mathscr{X} = \\{ X_1, X_2, \\cdots, X_N \\} \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}^{L \\times T}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ \\mathscr{X} $ represents a set of space-time codewords, each denoted by $ X_i $, where $ i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N $.\n",
    "   - Each codeword $ X_i $ is a complex matrix of dimension $ L \\times T $, where $ L $ is the number of transmit antennas and $ T $ is the number of time slots.\n",
    "   - This notation implies that the codeword set $ \\mathscr{X} $ is a subset of the space of all $ L \\times T $ complex matrices, $ \\mathbb{C}^{L \\times T} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Power Constraint**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\mathbb{E}\\{|X|_T^2\\} = P \\cdot T\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ \\mathbb{E}\\{|X|_T^2\\} $ is the **expected squared norm** (or power) of a codeword over $ T $ time slots.\n",
    "   - This expression states that the average power of each codeword $ X $ is normalized to a total power $ P $ over $ T $ time slots. Thus, $ P \\cdot T $ is the total power constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Probability Bound**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   P_{err} \\leq \\frac{4^L}{P^L \\cdot \\det( \\Delta X \\Delta X^\\prime )}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ P_{err} $ denotes the probability of decoding error.\n",
    "   - This inequality gives an upper bound on the error probability, inversely related to the power $ P $ and the determinant of the **difference matrix** $ \\Delta X \\Delta X^\\prime $.\n",
    "   - $ \\Delta X \\Delta X^\\prime $ represents the product of difference matrices, and a higher determinant suggests better codeword separation, thus reducing error probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Codeword Subsets**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\mathscr{X}_C = \\{ X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4 \\}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\mathscr{X}_S = \\{ Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4 \\}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ \\mathscr{X}_C $ and $ \\mathscr{X}_S $ are subsets of the main codeword set $ \\mathscr{X} $. \n",
    "   - They could represent different groups of codewords with different roles or structures (e.g., part of a space-time block code with varying encoding strategies).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Parameter Values**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   L = 2, \\quad T = 2\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ L = 2 $: There are 2 transmit antennas.\n",
    "   - $ T = 2 $: Each codeword spans 2 time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Data Rate**:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   R = \\frac{\\log_2 |\\mathscr{X}|}{T} = \\frac{\\log_2 4}{2} = 1 \\text{ b.p.c.u}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - $ R $ is the **transmission rate** in **bits per channel use (b.p.c.u.)**.\n",
    "   - $ |\\mathscr{X}| = 4 $ implies there are 4 distinct codewords in $ \\mathscr{X} $.\n",
    "   - Since $ T = 2 $, the rate $ R = 1 $ b.p.c.u. means 1 bit is transmitted per channel use.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Procedure for Code Design\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Power Normalization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Normalize the power of each codeword to meet the average power constraint $ P $ over $ T $ time slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Pairwise Comparison of Codewords**:\n",
    "\n",

    "   &\\quad \\text{end} \\\\\n",
    "   &\\text{end}\n",
    "   \\end{aligned}\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   - Iterate over each unique pair of codewords $ (X_i, X_j) $ and compute the **difference matrix** $ \\Delta X' = X_i' - X_j' $.\n",
    "   - Calculate the determinant $ \\det(\\Delta X' \\Delta X'^{*}) $, which measures the separation between codewords.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Minimize Determinant for Coding Gain**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \\min_{\\Delta X'} \\left\\{ \\det(\\Delta X' \\Delta X'^{*}) \\right\\}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Find the minimum determinant over all pairs of codewords. Maximizing this minimum value increases codeword separation, reducing the probability of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this setup outlines a space-time code design process emphasizing **power normalization, codeword separation using determinant criteria, and rate computation** to enhance coding performance and reliability in MIMO systems."
