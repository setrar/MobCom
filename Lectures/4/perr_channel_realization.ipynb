    "### Probability of error for a given channel realization\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression $ P_{\\text{err}|h} = Q\\left(\\frac{\\text{half distance}}{\\alpha}\\right) $ represents the probability of error for a given channel realization $ h $ in the context of digital communication systems. Here's a breakdown of each part:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of the Expression\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **$ P_{\\text{err}|h} $**:\n",
    "   - This is the **conditional probability of error** given a specific channel realization $ h $.\n",
    "   - In a fading or time-varying channel, $ h $ represents the channel gain or channel coefficient for a particular transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$ Q(\\cdot) $ Function**:\n",
    "   - The $ Q $-function, $ Q(x) $, is the **tail probability** of a standard normal distribution, defined as:\n",
    "     $\n",
    "     Q(x) = \\int_x^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{t^2}{2}} \\, dt\n",
    "     $\n",
    "   - It represents the probability that a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and variance 1 is greater than $ x $.\n",
    "   - In communication systems, $ Q(x) $ is used to express the probability of a decision error in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Half Distance**:\n",
    "   - The \"half distance\" generally refers to **half the minimum distance** between signal points in a modulation scheme (e.g., binary phase shift keying, BPSK).\n",
    "   - For BPSK, for instance, the minimum distance between the two points representing \"0\" and \"1\" is twice the amplitude of the signal, so half the distance would simply be the amplitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **$ \\alpha $**:\n",
    "   - The parameter $ \\alpha $ represents the **standard deviation of the noise** (assuming additive white Gaussian noise, AWGN).\n",
    "   - If the noise has power $ N_0/2 $ per dimension, then $ \\alpha = \\sqrt{N_0/2} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting It Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression $ Q\\left(\\frac{\\text{half distance}}{\\alpha}\\right) $ quantifies the **probability of error** for the received signal given noise and the particular channel gain $ h $. It captures how likely it is for the receiver to incorrectly decide on the transmitted symbol in the presence of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: When $ \\frac{\\text{half distance}}{\\alpha} $ is large, the argument of the $ Q $-function is large, and $ Q(x) $ approaches zero, meaning the probability of error is low.\n",
    "- **Low SNR**: When $ \\frac{\\text{half distance}}{\\alpha} $ is small, the probability of error increases because the noise can easily disrupt the decision process.\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability of error expression is widely used in digital communication to assess the performance of modulation schemes under noisy conditions."
