    "In this section, we will consider the encoding of polar codes and prove the part of Theorem 5 about encoding complexity. We begin by giving explicit algebraic expressions for $G_N$ ,the generator matrix for polar coding, which so far has been defined only in a schematic form by Fig. 3. The algebraic forms of $G_N$ naturally point at efficient implementations of the encoding operation $x_1^N = u_1^N G_N$ . In analyzing the encoding operation $G_N$ , we exploit its relation to fast transform methods in signal processing; in particular, we use the bit-indexing idea of [11] to interpret the various permutation operations that are\n",
