The notation "Detection NonCoh-Coh-DoF-snr-1" appears to be shorthand for a detection or signal processing setup involving several specific concepts:

1. **Detection**: This likely refers to a **signal detection** process, where the presence of a signal is identified against noise. Detection theory is commonly used in radar, communications, and statistics.

2. **NonCoh-Coh**: This likely indicates a comparison or configuration between **Non-Coherent** and **Coherent Detection** methods.
   - **Coherent Detection**: Requires knowledge of the signal phase and often achieves better performance in terms of sensitivity and reliability, especially at high SNR.
   - **Non-Coherent Detection**: Does not rely on phase information and is typically more robust in environments where phase information is not readily available or is unreliable. Non-coherent detection generally performs worse at low SNR compared to coherent detection.

3. **DoF (Degrees of Freedom)**: This could refer to the **degrees of freedom** in the detection process, which may relate to:
   - **Spatial DoF**: Multiple antennas or spatial paths (such as in MIMO systems) provide more DoF, which can improve detection reliability.
   - **Temporal DoF**: Multiple time instances of data, which can be used to improve detection accuracy.
   - **Frequency DoF**: Using multiple frequencies or bandwidths to increase detection reliability.

4. **SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**: This represents the **signal-to-noise ratio** of the detection process, which is crucial in determining the performance of both coherent and non-coherent detectors. A higher SNR usually improves the accuracy of detection.

5. **Suffix "-1"**: This could represent an **identifier for a specific configuration or setting**, possibly referring to a specific test case or experiment.

### Interpretation
"Detection NonCoh-Coh-DoF-snr-1" might represent a detection scenario where both **non-coherent** and **coherent detection methods** are considered, potentially under different **degrees of freedom** and **SNR conditions**. This notation likely describes a specific configuration or experiment to evaluate or compare detection performance.
