# Doppler Effect

The Doppler effect is a phenomenon observed when there is a relative motion between a source of waves (such as sound or light) and an observer. It results in a change in frequency (and consequently wavelength) of the waves perceived by the observer.

### Key Points:

1. **Sound Waves**:
   - When the source of sound is moving towards the observer, the sound waves are compressed, leading to a higher frequency (or pitch). This is why an approaching siren sounds higher in pitch.
   - Conversely, when the source is moving away from the observer, the sound waves are stretched, resulting in a lower frequency (or pitch). This is why a receding siren sounds lower in pitch.

2. **Light Waves**:
   - For light waves, a similar effect occurs. When a light source moves towards an observer, the light appears shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum (blue shift).
   - When the source moves away, the light appears shifted towards the red end of the spectrum (red shift).

3. **Applications**:
   - The Doppler effect has practical applications in various fields, including:
     - **Astronomy**: To determine the speed and direction of stars and galaxies.
     - **Radar and Sonar**: To measure the speed of moving objects, such as vehicles or submarines.
     - **Medical Imaging**: In Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow in vessels.

4. **Formula**:
   - The observed frequency $f'$ can be calculated using the formula:
     $$f' = f \frac{v + v_o}{v + v_s}$$
     where:
     - $f$ = emitted frequency
     - $v$ = speed of the wave in the medium
     - $v_o$ = speed of the observer (positive if moving towards the source)
     - $v_s$ = speed of the source (positive if moving away from the observer)

### Summary:
The Doppler effect is a critical concept in wave physics that explains how the frequency of waves changes based on the relative motion between the source and the observer, with applications across various scientific fields.
