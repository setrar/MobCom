# Mobile communication techniques


ELIA Petros

## Abstract

The goal of MOBCOM is to provide a fundamental understanding of mobile communication systems. The course will seek to describe the key aspects of channel characteristics/modeling, of communication techniques, and to describe the application of these techniques in wireless communication systems.

`Teaching and Learning Methods:` Lectures and Lab sessions (group of 2-3 students).

`Course Policies:` Attendance at the lab session is mandatory.

Requirements
Knowledge in discrete math, probability theory, random processes, transform theory


## Description
