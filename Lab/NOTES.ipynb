    "Provide the Details of How You Simulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tSet Up the Channel: For each problem, define the channel model based on the specified parameters (i.e., 16-PAM symbols, Gaussian fading, Rician fading, or ￼ distribution). Identify the random variables to be generated and their distributions.\n",
    "-\tPower Normalization: For each simulation, compute the normalization factor ￼ to regulate the SNR. Explain how you calculated ￼ based on the relation between signal power and noise power.\n",
    "-\tMonte Carlo Simulation: Use a Monte Carlo approach to run many independent iterations. In each iteration:\n",
    "    1.\tGenerate random channel gains (￼) and noise (￼).\n",
    "    1.\tRandomly select transmitted symbols (￼) from the 16-PAM constellation or other specified sets.\n",
    "    1.\tCompute the received signal (￼) based on the channel model.\n",
    "    1.\tPerform decoding using the maximum likelihood (ML) rule or other appropriate criteria.\n",
    "-\tCalculate Metrics: Measure probability of error (e.g., number of errors divided by total transmissions) or probability of deep fade (￼) depending on the problem.\n",
    "-\tLogarithmic Scale: Convert probability metrics to log scale (￼) for plotting. Use SNR values in dB for the x-axis.\n",
    "-\tVisualize Results: Plot the metrics (e.g., error probability or deep fade probability) against SNR (dB). Superimpose empirical results and theoretical predictions where applicable. Label graphs with titles, axis labels, and captions.\n",
    "-\tDescribe Variations: For each problem, explain the simulation settings, including how channel gains, symbols, noise, and other parameters are varied. For instance:\n",
    "-\tIn Problem 1, discuss how the codewords and channel gains are updated.\n",
    "-\tIn Problems 2 and 3, explain how the fading distribution is modified (e.g., Rician or ￼ distribution).\n",
    "-\tValidation: For Problem 4, perform statistical experiments to verify the given approximations. Generate random variables, compute histograms, and compare with theoretical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document all steps clearly, including any assumptions or approximations made during the simulations."
