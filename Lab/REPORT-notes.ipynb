    "PROVIDE THE DETAILS OF HOW YOU SIMULATED:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **SET UP THE CHANNEL:** FOR EACH PROBLEM, DEFINE THE CHANNEL MODEL BASED ON THE SPECIFIED PARAMETERS (I.E., 16-PAM SYMBOLS, GAUSSIAN FADING, RICIAN FADING, OR $\\chi^2$ DISTRIBUTION). IDENTIFY THE RANDOM VARIABLES TO BE GENERATED AND THEIR DISTRIBUTIONS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **POWER NORMALIZATION:** FOR EACH SIMULATION, COMPUTE THE NORMALIZATION FACTOR $\\theta$ TO REGULATE THE SNR. EXPLAIN HOW YOU CALCULATED $\\theta$ BASED ON THE RELATION BETWEEN SIGNAL POWER AND NOISE POWER.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **MONTE CARLO SIMULATION:** USE A MONTE CARLO APPROACH TO RUN MANY INDEPENDENT ITERATIONS. IN EACH ITERATION:\n",
    "  1. GENERATE RANDOM CHANNEL GAINS ($h$) AND NOISE ($w$).\n",
    "  2. RANDOMLY SELECT TRANSMITTED SYMBOLS ($x$) FROM THE 16-PAM CONSTELLATION OR OTHER SPECIFIED SETS.\n",
    "  3. COMPUTE THE RECEIVED SIGNAL ($y$) BASED ON THE CHANNEL MODEL.\n",
    "  4. PERFORM DECODING USING THE MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD (ML) RULE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE CRITERIA.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CALCULATE METRICS:** MEASURE PROBABILITY OF ERROR (E.G., NUMBER OF ERRORS DIVIDED BY TOTAL TRANSMISSIONS) OR PROBABILITY OF DEEP FADE ($P(\\|\\tilde{h}\\|^2 < \\text{SNR}^{-1})$) DEPENDING ON THE PROBLEM.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **LOGARITHMIC SCALE:** CONVERT PROBABILITY METRICS TO LOG SCALE ($\\log_{10}(\\text{Prob})$) FOR PLOTTING. USE SNR VALUES IN dB FOR THE X-AXIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VISUALIZE RESULTS:** PLOT THE METRICS (E.G., ERROR PROBABILITY OR DEEP FADE PROBABILITY) AGAINST SNR (dB). SUPERIMPOSE EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS WHERE APPLICABLE. LABEL GRAPHS WITH TITLES, AXIS LABELS, AND CAPTIONS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **DESCRIBE VARIATIONS:** FOR EACH PROBLEM, EXPLAIN THE SIMULATION SETTINGS, INCLUDING HOW CHANNEL GAINS, SYMBOLS, NOISE, AND OTHER PARAMETERS ARE VARIED. FOR INSTANCE:\n",
    "  - IN PROBLEM 1, DISCUSS HOW THE CODEWORDS AND CHANNEL GAINS ARE UPDATED.\n",
    "  - IN PROBLEMS 2 AND 3, EXPLAIN HOW THE FADING DISTRIBUTION IS MODIFIED (E.G., RICIAN OR $\\chi^2$ DISTRIBUTION).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **VALIDATION:** FOR PROBLEM 4, PERFORM STATISTICAL EXPERIMENTS TO VERIFY THE GIVEN APPROXIMATIONS. GENERATE RANDOM VARIABLES, COMPUTE HISTOGRAMS, AND COMPARE WITH THEORETICAL EXPRESSIONS.  \n",
    "\n",
    "DOCUMENT ALL STEPS CLEARLY, INCLUDING ANY ASSUMPTIONS OR APPROXIMATIONS MADE DURING THE SIMULATIONS."
