    "### **Problem 3: Deep Fade Probability with $\\chi^2$-Squared Fading Distribution**\n",

    "### **Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reduced Variability:**\n",
    "   - The $\\chi^2$-squared distribution with $6$ degrees of freedom represents more diversity in the channel compared to a single Rician variable ($2$ degrees of freedom).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lower Deep Fade Probability:**\n",
    "   - The $\\chi^2$-squared fading probability curve lies below the single Rician variable and the 3-length vector probabilities due to the higher degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Smoother Decay:**\n",
    "   - As SNR increases, the $\\chi^2$-squared curve decays more smoothly compared to the steep drops observed in the Rician models.\n",
