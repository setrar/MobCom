    "A disadvantage of operating in a very dense urban setting with smaller cells is the increased frequency of handovers. Since users frequently move between small cells, the network must handle more handovers, which can increase signaling overhead, reduce data throughput, and degrade the user experience due to more frequent interruptions in connectivity. Additionally, interference between neighboring cells can be higher, requiring more sophisticated interference management techniques."
