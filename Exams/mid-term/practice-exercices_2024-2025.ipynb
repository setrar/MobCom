    "In a $1 \\times n_r$ **SIMO Rayleigh fading channel** (single-input, multiple-output), the average **probability of error** at **high SNR** can be approximated using diversity and fading statistics. Let’s break down the key steps and results for this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Channel Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **SIMO Rayleigh fading channel**, the received signal is:\n",
    "$y = h x + n$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $h = [h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_{n_r}]$ is the $1 \\times n_r$ channel vector with i.i.d. complex Gaussian entries ($h_i \\sim \\mathcal{CN}(0, 1)$),\n",
    "- $x$ is the transmitted signal,\n",
    "- $n \\sim \\mathcal{CN}(0, N_0)$ is complex additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).\n",
    "\n",
    "At high SNR, **maximum ratio combining (MRC)** can be used to improve the detection performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Effective SNR**\n",
    "\n",
    "The effective SNR after MRC is given by:\n",
    "$\\gamma_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{P}{N_0} \\| h \\|^2 = \\frac{P}{N_0} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_r} |h_i|^2$\n",
    "where $|h_i|^2$ follows an exponential distribution, and $\\|h\\|^2 \\sim \\text{Gamma}(n_r, 1)$ (sum of $n_r$ i.i.d. Rayleigh squared magnitudes).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Average Probability of Error**\n",
    "\n",
    "The average probability of error for high SNR can be approximated by considering the **diversity order**, which is $n_r$. For common modulation schemes like BPSK or QPSK, the average probability of symbol error $P_e$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_e \\approx \\frac{C}{\\text{SNR}^{n_r}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\text{SNR} = \\frac{P}{N_0}$,\n",
    "- $C$ is a constant that depends on the modulation type (e.g., for BPSK, $C = \\frac{1}{2^{n_r - 1} (n_r - 1)!}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. High-SNR Approximation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In high SNR, the **diversity order** $n_r$ determines the rate at which the error probability decays. The probability of error for Rayleigh fading in a $1 \\times n_r$ system is approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P_e \\approx \\left( \\frac{1}{4 \\gamma_{\\text{avg}}} \\right)^{n_r}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\gamma_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{P}{N_0}$ is the average SNR.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a $1 \\times n_r$ SIMO Rayleigh fading channel at high SNR:\n",
    "- The average error probability decays as $\\text{SNR}^{-n_r}$, showing the impact of **diversity gain**.\n",
    "- The exact expression for $P_e$ depends on the modulation scheme and can often be written in the form:\n",
    "$P_e \\approx \\frac{C}{\\text{SNR}^{n_r}}$\n",
    "- For large $n_r$, the error probability decreases significantly due to diversity."
